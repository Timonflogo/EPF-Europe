This paper investigates the performance of multiple state-of-the-art Elec-
tricity Price Forecasting methods as well as the novel Facebook prophet time
series forecasting algorithms in periods of high volatility in different bidding
areas of the Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, and German energy markets. On
top of the of the Covid-19 pandemic which already put Europe in an un-
favourable position in regards to their energy resources, the recent develop-
ments in the Ukrainian-Russian conflict, which saw the EU bloc and its allies
impose massive sanctions on the Russian economy, subsequently raising ten-
sions between Russia and the western allies, which now threatens to further
destabilise Europeâ€™s energy supply. Electricity prices have been soaring and
due to the current market volatility, it has become increasingly more difficult
to obtain accurate short-term forecasts of day-ahead electricity prices, raising
uncertainty for all stakeholders involved.
